/**
 * - By default, every holder is a root of itself and has no parent
 * - If a parent is passed at construction time, then a holder will have this as a parent,
 *   and it will adopt the parent's root as its root as well
 * - If two or more holders that don't have a parent get linked, at linking time, a dummy holder will
 *    be constructed which will act as a root, and it is considered virtual since its only purpose is to be a root.
 *
 * This allows tracking all levels of the exploration tree, and therefore all holders are potentially pushable
